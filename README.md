# Comed Live Prices

We are making REST calls to see what the current ComEd Real Time or Live Prices are so we can make some decisions on if we should charge our EV or wait until prices are more favorable. 

Longer term it would be nice to crate a google action.

ComEd's Hourly Pricing API can be foud [**here.**](https://hourlypricing.comed.com/hp-api/)
